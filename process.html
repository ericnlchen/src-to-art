                        A variety of existing systems empower us to transform code into drawings. <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a>, <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, and <a href="https://openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a> let us
                        write programs to manipulate shapes, colors, and forms. These tools are intended to enable visual creation. But rich complexity exists within code, regardless of intention. <strong>What if we could build a system to map arbitrary works of code to visual representations? My goal was to reinterpret utility as wonder.</strong>

                        Mapping Tokens to Shapes
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Initially, I thought of L-systems. Maybe each semantic token of a program could be interpreted as a drawing instruction. I considered "turtle" instructions like <em>draw forward</em> or <em>turn right</em> but guessed that this approach might be visually messy without capturing the inherent structure in the code. Next I imagined mapping tokens to primitive shapes, with parameters governing properties of the shapes. For example, a for-loop with 6 iterations could map to 6 consecutive circles.

                        <li><strong>Composition</strong>&mdash;how can I place the primitives in a visually interesting way that reflects something about the code?</li>
                        <li><strong>Primitives</strong>&mdash;just using simple shapes could be pretty limiting.</li>

                        Using Text as an Element

                    <p>
                        Inspired by Travess's guidance towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_poetry">concrete poetry</a>, I began experimenting with a pretty different idea: <strong>using the text of the code itself to create visual elements</strong>. A blurring and thresholding procedure transformed the example text <code>"random(100, 256)"</code> into these forms:

                    <p>
                        Another interesting discovery was the unexpected appearance of all kinds of cartoony faces!
